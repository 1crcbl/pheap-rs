# Pairing Heap

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_heap):
> A pairing heap is a type of heap data structure with relatively simple implementation and excellent practical amortized performance.
> Pairing heaps are heap-ordered multiway tree structures, and can be considered simplified Fibonacci heaps. They are considered a "robust choice" for implementing such algorithms as Prim's MST algorithm.
